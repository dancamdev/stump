# benchmarks

This will eventually contain benchmarks primarily for the `core` crate for Stump. This is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, as there is a LOT of work to do before it makes ~sense~ to benchmark, however it would be nice to have it in place to know progress is being made. But, at this point, it would just be another thing to maintain before the code is in a state where it makes sense to benchmark.
